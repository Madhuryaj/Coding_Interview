Exercise 1
Your product owner has reported that a bug has been found.
To recreate, try and book more tickets than there are available. What happens?
In your code editor, please fix the bug.

Exercise 2
The program assumes that a user will input a certain set of characters.
What happens when you input something that the program does not expect?
In your code editor, can you improve this experience for the user?

Exercise 3
The company has purchased a new fleet of trains and they can now offer 5 first class seats
priced at €150 per seat.
They would like to allow customers to book either standard or first-class seating through the
program.
In your code editor, please add this new functionality to the program.
Some things to consider in your solution:
• How will the customer be able to specify standard or first class.
• How will the program now determine the price of the booking?
• How do we calculate the number of available seats, now that we have two ticket types?
